# MTImageMapView  
## üèóÔ∏èüë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 2013 [iOS MTImageMapView](https://github.com/stkim1/MTImageMapView) Android port üè°

An image view to select __a complex polygon__ (`map` henceforth) out of many. 
Extremely useful for handling touches on, for example, Europe map, or an eye of owl.  

## Screen Shots

## Features  

- Handling multiple maps on an image<sup>1</sup>, just like html [\<area\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area) tag  
- Batch mapping  
- Interface to provide selected map id  
- Debug mode to superimpose maps' polygon path on an image (the left in the screenshot)  

1. There is no limit but you need to be reasonable. In this example, I put about 50 polygon maps on the map in the screenshot above.  

## Support  

- From Android API 24  

## Library Setup  
- Download [`MTImageMapView-0.1-rc3.aar`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stkim1/view.MTImageMapView/main/dist/MTImageMapView-0.1-rc3.aar)  
- Place it in `libs` folder  
![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stkim1/view.MTImageMapView/main/doc/lib_install.png)  
- edit `build.gradle.kts`  
```kotlin
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation(fileTree(mapOf("dir" to "libs", "include" to listOf("*.aar", "*.jar"))))
}
```  
- or `build.gradle`  
```groovy
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation(fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['.aar', '.jar']))
}
```  
- `clean` and `build`  

## Implementation with JSON  
1. Use tools like [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) and generate a image map.  
2. Take only `[x,y]` coordinate pairs of the map (e.g. `[[123,456],[789,123],[456,789]]`).  
3. Write JSON in the following format.  
```json
[
    {
        "id": "Alabama",
        "vertices": [[409,298],[409,298],[411,292],[409,279]]
    },
    {
        "id": {
            "name": "Alaska",
            "code": "AZ",
            "dial": 907,
            "desc": "Alaska State Polygon Map"
        },
        "vertices": [[58,294],[56,293],[55,292],[54,292],[51,294]]
    },
    {
        "vertices": [[163,213],[153,290],[131,288],[90,266]],
        "description": "An area map without an id"
    }
]
```
4. For the `id` field, you can use good-old string, object, or totally eliminate it if you want to. You can mix up with other fields such as `description`.  
5. Nonetheless, the __`vertices`__ field has to be there, and it should maintain coordinates in the aforementioned array format in #2. The field and format will be enforced in the future versions.  
6. Instantiate `MTImageMapView` and implement `MTImageMapTouch` interface. Then pass the map to the instance of `MTImageMapView`.  
```kotlin
val jsonMaps = assets.open("us_states.json")
                .bufferedReader()
                .use { it.readText() }

val moshi = Moshi.Builder()
                .add(PolygonAdapter())
                .build()

val mapList: List<MTPolygon> = moshi
                .adapter<List<MTPolygon>>()
                .fromJson(jsonMaps) as List<MTPolygon>

val usState : Drawable? = AppCompatResources
                .getDrawable(applicationContext, R.drawable.us_states)

val mapView : MTImageMapView = findViewById(R.id.imageMapView)
    mapView.setImageDrawable(usState)
    mapView.setTouchedMapReceiver(this)
    mapView.setShowPath(true)
    mapView.setPolygons(mapList)
```  

### Javadoc  

- [v0.1-rc3 Javadoc](https://html-preview.github.io/?https://github.com/stkim1/view.MTImageMapView/blob/main/doc/index.html)

### Sample Image and Maps  

- A [US states image](https://github.com/stkim1/view.MTImageMapView/blob/main/sample/US_States.gif) in size of 600 x 383 px.  
- The [polygon maps](https://github.com/stkim1/view.MTImageMapView/blob/main/sample/assets/us_states.json) of the US states in JSON.  

### Example App  

- [MTImageMapView Example](https://github.com/stkim1/MTImageMapViewExample)  

### Limits & Cautions 

- ‚ú® The coordinates of a polygon map must be provided in an array of `[x, y]` pairs in `vertices` field. For the compatibility of upcoming updates, this format will be enforced. üåü 
- When you're to debug, it is convinient to split the screen space where touch event takes place from the logical space of `dp` unit where you draw polygon maps on an image with graphic tools. It is necessary due to the situation in which every Android device has different screen dpi.  
- `MTImageMapTouch` interface delivers 
  1. Android native touch event in the screen pixel space,
  2. the point of touch in logical space, and 
  3. the polygon map selected.  
- At least 3 pairs of coordinates must present to form a polygon map.  
- No "rect", "circle" type map is supported. "__polygon__" only at this time being.

isLeft(): tests if the object's point (hence the point) is Left|On|Right of an infinite line.
Input   : the point, P0, and P1
Return  : >0 for the point is at the left of the line through P0 and P1
          =0 for the point is on the line
          <0 for the point is at the right of the line

fastWindingNumber(): winding number test for a point in a polygon
Input   : polygon = vertex points of a polygon V[n+1] with V[n]=V[0]
             point = a point
Return  : wn = the winding number (=0 only when the point is outside)
